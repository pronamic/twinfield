# [DEPRECATED] Twinfield  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/pronamic/twinfield.png?branch=develop)](http://travis-ci.org/pronamic/twinfield)

**This library is moved to https://github.com/php-twinfield/twinfield.**

A PHP library for Twinfield Integration. Developed by [Remco Tolsma](http://remcotolsma.nl/) and [Leon Rowland](http://leon.rowland.nl/) from [Pronamic](http://pronamic.nl/).
Use the Twinfield SOAP Service to have your PHP application communicate directly with your Twinfield account.

---

## Autoloading

The classes follow the PSR2 naming convention.


## Usage

### General Usage Information
Components will have Factories to simplify the request and send process of Twinfield.
Each factory will require just the \Pronamic\Twinfield\Secure\Config() class with
the filled in details.

An example of the usage of the Configuration class.

```php
$config = new \Pronamic\Twinfield\Secure\Config();
$config->setCredentials('Username', 'Password', 'Organization', 'Office');
```

* or, when using OAuth:

```php
$config = new \Pronamic\Twinfield\Secure\Config();
$config->setOAuthParameters('clientID', 'clientSecret', 'returnURL', 'Organization', 'Office', true);
//the true parameter at the end tells the system to automatically redirect to twinfield to login
```



Now, to the current modules

In the following example, we will use the Customer component as showcase. Although 
this will be the method for all components ( including Invoice currently )

Typically it is as follows, if using the Factories

* Add/Edit: Make Object, Make Factory, Give object in Submit method of related factory.
* Retrieve: Make Factory, Supply all required params to respective listAll() and get() methods

#### Add/Edit

Make your Customer object

```php
$customer = new \Pronamic\Twinfield\Customer\Customer();
$customer
	->setID(10666)
	->setName('Leon Rowland')
	->setType('DEB')
	->setWebsite('http://leon.rowland.nl')
	->setEBilling(true)
	->setEBillMail('leon@rowland.nl')
	->setVatCode('VL')
	->setDueDays(10)
	->setCocNumber('12341234');
```

Customers can have addresses associated with them

```php
$customerAddress = new \Pronamic\Twinfield\Customer\CustomerAddress();
$customerAddress
	->setDefault(false)
	->setType('invoice')
	->setField1('Testing field 1')
	->setField2('Testing field 2')
	->setField3('Testing field 3')
	->setPostcode('1212 AB')
	->setCity('TestCity')
	->setCountry('NL')
	->setTelephone('010-12345')
	->setFax('010-1234')
	->setEmail('test@email.com');
```

Assign that address to the customer

```php
$customer->addAddress($customerAddress);
```

Now lets submit it!

```php
use \Pronamic\Twinfield\Customer as TwinfieldCustomer;

// Config object prepared and passed to the CustomerFactory
$customerFactory = new TwinfieldCustomer\CustomerFactory($config);

//$customer = new TwinfieldCustomer\Customer();

// Attempt to send the Customer document
if($customerFactory->send($customer)){
	// Use the Mapper to turn the response back into a TwinfieldCustomer\Customer
	$successfulCustomer = TwinfieldCustomer\Mapper\CustomerMapper::map($customerFactory->getResponse());
}
```

#### Retrieve/Request

You can get all customers or get a single one currently.

```php
use \Pronamic\Twinfield\Customer as TwinfieldCustomer;

// Config object prepared and passed into the CustomerFactory
$customerFactory = new TwinfieldCustomer\CustomerFactory($config);

$customers = $customerFactory->listAll();
```

At the moment, listAll will return an array of just name and short name.

```php

$customer = $customerFactory->get('customerCode', 'office[optional]');
```

The response from get() will be a \Pronamic\Twinfield\Customer\Customer object.


#### Notes

Advanced documentation coming soon. Detailing usage without the Factory class. Giving you more control
with the response and data as well as more in-depth examples and usage recommendations.


## Contribute

You can contribute to the development of this project. Try and keep to the way of doing things as
the other 2 components have implemented.

A large requirement is to maintain backwards compatibility so if you have any plans for large
restructure or alteration please bring up in an issue first.
